      <h2>NSBE 49th Conference</h2>
      <p class="date">Date: March 22nd, 2023</p>
      <p class="location">Location: Kansas City, Missouri</p>
      <p class="description">Description: I had the great opportunity to attend on the 24thrd of March 2023 NSBE's 49th conference at the Kansas City Convention Centre. I was thrilled to have the chance to talk with amazing recruiters and learn about companies that I was unaware of. After dozens of rejections applying for internships online I wasn't offered even one interview. But this conference gave me the path to talk to recruiters face-to-face and impress them with my resume. It was definitely a humbling experience as I have a lot of skills to improve upon and this was an eye-opener for me.</p>
